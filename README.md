# Introduction
Shangridocs is a document exploration tool for the biomedical domain which takes inspiration
from [Utopiadocs](http://utopiadocs.com/) but provides the following killer features
 * A fully functional Java EE Web Application (.war) for deployment in application servers such as Apache Tomcat
 * Shangridocs consults many more biomedical data sources from which knowledge augmentation occurs and users can benefit

# Build Instructions
1. git clone https://github.com/chrismattmann/shangridocs
2. cd shangridocs
3. mvn install

# Starting instructions
Then, to start Shangridocs, you need:

## Apache Tika Server ##

2. mkdir -p tika/server
3. mkdir -p tika/ctakes
4. cd tika/server
5. git clone https://github.com/apache/tika.git
6. cd tika && mvn install
4. java -jar tika-server/target/tika-server-1.11-SNAPSHOT.jar > ../tika-server.log 2>&1&

## Apache cTAKES Server ##

1. See guide for installing cTAKES and Tika here:
https://wiki.apache.org/tika/cTAKESParser
2. Start the server on port 9999

## Start Shangridocs web app in testing mode
